Hi, I’m Sebastien. I’m an experienced engineer and hands-on leader with a passion for building and optimizing high-performance systems. Whether working as an individual contributor or leading a team, I enjoy tackling technical challenges and delivering impactful solutions.

I started this blog to share my work on GPU performance optimization and to document the insights I’ve gained along the way.

All content on this blog is created in my spare time and reflects my personal views—not those of my past or present employers.

If you’d like to connect or discuss GPU optimization, feel free to reach out via email at :
